### Hello, World! 👋

I am **Vipul Taneja**, an enthusiastic software engineer. I graduated from the University of Toronto with a specialist in Computer Science, where I refined my skills in algorithm design, data structures, and software development.

👨‍💻 Previously, I worked at [Faire](https://www.faire.com/), where I worked as a software engineer. At Faire, I had the opportunity to collaborate on cutting-edge projects, contributing to the development of innovative solutions.

### What I Bring to the Table:

- 🛠 Experience in **Python, Java, Kotlin, React, React Native, Django, SQL, NoSQL, RESTful API** and many more technologies.
- 🧠 Strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- 🚀 Passionate about building scalable and efficient software solutions.

### Projects Highlights:

Here are some of the recent projects I have worked on:

- **[RESTify](https://github.com/tanejavipul/RESTify)**: Social hub for restaurants. Users search, follow, like, and comment. Owners showcase with blog posts and menus, creating dynamic connections.
- [HTTP Server](https://github.com/tanejavipul/HTTP-Server): An HTTP server capable of handling HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1 requests and processing 10,000 requests in under 0.8 seconds.
- [Brain Tumor Detector](https://github.com/tanejavipul/Brain-Tumor-Detector): A 4-layer Convolutional Neural Network with 2 fully connected layers to detect the presence of a tumor in an X-Ray.

### Current Endeavors:

🌐 Currently, I'm expanding my skill set with a focus on the following:

- 📚 Pursuing a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/learn/lecture/20053442?start=15#overview) in AWS to deepen my understanding of cloud computing and infrastructure, with plans to obtain certification.
- 🚗 Exploring the exciting field of [self-driving cars](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars), diving into the intricacies of autonomous vehicle technology.
